  <p>In my reflection, I will be sharing my reflection and experience with Assignment 3 Project.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards). My system is a website that sells YETI products. YETI is a popular brand mostly known for their metallic water bottles. In my system, I started off by selling different color YETI water bottles like blue or green ones. In assignment 3 I added two more sections labeled sleeves and totes. In these categories, I did the same thing selling YETI water bottle sleeves and YETI tote cooler bags in different colors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented? Some shortcomings I faced was the mail not sending. For some reason, I could not figure out how to get the users email from the login to be implemented in my invoice page and then sent out using the nodemailer system. I felt like I had all the code to do so but it just wouldn’t work. I also had a few syntax or technical errors that I tried to fix but couldn’t or just left because I wanted the main parts of my webpage to work instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe what you are most proud of about your system: I am most proud that my website is a website and that it works. I have never coded in my life, nor made my own ecommerce website so I am extremely happy that I was able to even create a webpage and have it functional. Despite some setbacks/error I may have in my website, I am extremely proud of my hard work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe what you are least happy with your system: I am least happy that I could not implement everything that was needed. To come this far and not have a complete website with all the requirements was frustrating. I am also not happy with the way the website looks. I wish I could edit the css more and make the website as a whole more visually appealing so that when people try it or when users go on they are amazed at it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2? Developing this assignment was way different than assignment 2 because it had to do a lot with cookies and session which I did not fully understand. It was extremely hard to get over that hump and really understand how to code and understand all these high level, technical concepts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it? When I ran into a problem, I would really try to look at it from the outside and see what needs to be done and how can I get there. It is really easy to mess up and get frustrated so I often found myself taking a step back and relaxing, really trying to understand what needed to be done. Once I had the steps, I could figure out how to do it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment? In this assignment, I found that working on each page seperately really helped. Instead of trying to work on everything little by little and making it all come together, I found that working on one page at a time and then putting all the pages together when it was completed really helped me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment? One thing that did not work well was simply typing out new code just to write it. I noticed that I would often change code and type random things hoping that it would work when in reality it only strayed me farther from the end goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did you learn from doing this assignment? From this assignment, I learned that when challenges are met, it is important to have time management and not get too worked. Multiple times during this assignment I wanted to throw my computer across the room, or pull my hair out. It was important for me to relax and make sure I stay level headed no matter the situation or circumstance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change? One thing I would change is to really practice on my free time. Coding and programming is not something you can read a manual on or listen in class and automatically be able to do it. It is important to constantly practice and better yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging. I probbaly spent 20% of the time thinking, 20% coding, and 60% testing and debugging. I noticed that testing often took the longest for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”) I did this project myself and contributed to it 100%.</p>
  </li>
