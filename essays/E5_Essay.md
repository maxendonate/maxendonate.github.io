In my reflection, I will be sharing my reflection and experience with Assignment 2 Project. 

1. In my assignment 2 project, I added a login page, registration page, and an edit page. This built upon what we did on Assignment 1 (creating a title page, products display page, and an invoice page). In Assignment 2, my login page was pretty standard as to where the user would have to input an email and password that is already displayed on the user_data.json page. If both username and passwords match, then you are able to login. My register and edit registration page was also very similar to the login page in terms of code and design. The hardest part for me was creating all the code in order for all of these new webpages to run how they are supposed to in the server. 
2. One thing I learned was how to create more complex codes on servers and link the user_data.json information onto the webpage. It was really interesting to go through the process of denying and accepting various entries onto the webpage and ensuring the correct information was able to pass through, while the incorrect password was denied entry. 
3. I did not work with a partner. I contributed to the project 100%. 
4. The best way I got help was through various different resources. First of all I relied a lot on Professor Port and other classmates to help me out and give me advice along the way. All the students in ITM352 were struggling with it together and it was nice to reach out and help one another out. I also used Chat GBT and Stack Overflow to help me, along with the previous Labs. 
5. Developing this assignment was different because there was a lot to worry about. In Assignment 1, you simply had to make sure the invoice page was running with the products you had. In this lab, you had to make requirements for any and all amounts of data and that was the most challenging. 
6. It didn't take me that long to think about what I was going to do because all the requirements and criteria was listed and I just need to figure out how exactly I was going to do it. Most of my time was spent on writing the code and testing it to ensure it was working. I would say that 10% is spent on thinking, 60% is used on writing the code, and 30% is used on testing and debugging. Testing took a lot of time because you had to constantly log in and try different methods to ensure it works properly. 
7. Something that worked well was starting early. By starting early and finishing soon, I was able to properly test my website and ask for questions when needed. This was a lot different than with Assignment 1 when I started late and found myself rushing and finding errors towards the submission date.
8. Something I would do differently is write more comments and truly figure out what is it I'm doing along the way. I noticed I try to do too much at once and it only either messes up my code, or confuses me even more than I already was.
