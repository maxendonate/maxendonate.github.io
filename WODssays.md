summary: "My reflection on my experience with WOD's 1-3."
---
In my reflection, I will be sharing my reflection and experience with all three workouts of the day. 

For WOD1, I first decided to watch the video completely through. It was a long video so I slowly observed what type of coding and language professor was using. After watching it one way through, I decided to work on it side by side, pausing the video when necessary to add in the step and to make sure I was good. Despite having the video side by side, I still struggling and finished my first attempt with a time of 48 minutes. I then once again watched the video on its own and started to copy the code less, but rather to understand what it's doing. This helped a lot because rather than remembering what code proffesor used in the video, I focused more on what he was trying to do. I did it one time on my own and got a time of 34 minutes. Despite missing the time, I successfully completed it on my own one way through. After I finished, I looked up the places I got stuck on and composed myself. This time, I was able to complete it within the time and understood what I was doing. For me, the hardest part was indenting both the words and the pictures. My advice would be to simply try to understand what professor Port is doing in the video and not simply copy his code. This allows you to learn and get a better understanding of coding as a whole.
For WOD2, I found it a lot easier. Once again, I used the same method as I did in WOD1 and simply watched the video first. Due to me having the outline completely finished, I found it a lot easier. I watched the entire video through, and then watch it through while following along. After that, I went for my 1st attempt alone, I got really stuck in one part and didn't realize what I was doing wrong. I even pulled up the video to see what I did wrong and I couldn't figure it out. Eventually I scratched my attempt and re-watched the video. After understanding the video and what I was supposed to do; I went for my next attempt. Once again, I got stuck in the same area but I figured out what I was doing wrong after a short period of time. I fixed my errors and finished WOD2. My advice is the same as my advice in WOD1. You need to watch the video and really understand what is going on. When you type your code, it is important to make sure you double check what you typed and that you save your page. 
Lastly for WOD3, I found is the easiest. For WOD3, all I did was watch the video one time and take notes. I then studied the notes and went back and forth through the video to see places I was slightly confused on. I was ready and went through it. I got confused and on one section, I had to replay the video. I ended my recording and studied the video. After I finished I tried it for my second attempt. I got it and completed it with ease. I feel like WOD 3 is the easiest one but it's important to study the material and understand what you are doing.
