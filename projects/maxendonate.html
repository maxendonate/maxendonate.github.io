<p>Since a young age, I have always been immersed in technology and the competitive advantage it grants. While growing up, I was interested in seeing technology advance before my eyes in ways I never thought possible. When I recieved my first iphone, I was infatuated by how futuristic and advanced the iphone was compared to the modern day flip phones. Little did I know that a decade later, you would be able to run an ecommerce business, pay at a store with the tap of your phone, make international calls to people 10,000 miles away, and take detailed pictures that some digital cameras can’t even take. Seeing this evolution right before my hands made me want to be apart of the industry that causes it. Discovering how to make a process quicker, or how we can make a product better is my passion and a field of study I wish to continue being a part of. I am excited to learn and can’t wait to see what the future holds in management information systems.   ,     :</p>
